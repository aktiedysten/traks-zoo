Example application for traks (https://github.com/aktiedysten/traks) - a translation system for React.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Try open `src/App.js`, add some translations (`<T>` tags), run `./update-translations.sh`, edit `src/traks-translations.js
` and see the results.

This demo is based on `create-react-app`. You can view the commit history as a series of steps for setting up traks.

Have fun!
